## [1.0.0] - 2025-11-15

### Added
- Initial release
- ResNet-18 landmark prediction model
- Basic CLI with train, evaluate, predict commands
- LandmarkDataset with CLAHE preprocessing
- Basic test suite

## Validated Results (Session 39-41)

### Landmark Prediction
- **Error**: 3.71 px (ensemble 4 models + TTA)
- Per-category: Normal 3.42 px, COVID 3.77 px, Viral 4.40 px

### Classification
- Original 100%: 98.84% accuracy
- Warped 99%: 98.73% accuracy

### Robustness (vs Original 100%)
- JPEG Q50: **30x more robust** (0.53% vs 16.14% degradation)
- JPEG Q30: **23x more robust** (1.32% vs 29.97% degradation)
- Blur sigma=1: **2.4x more robust** (6.06% vs 14.43% degradation)

### Cross-Dataset Generalization
- Warped model: **2.4x better** (gap 3.17% vs 7.70%)

### Robustness Mechanism
- ~75%: Information reduction (implicit regularization via reduced fill rate)
- ~25%: Geometric normalization (additional warping benefit)
