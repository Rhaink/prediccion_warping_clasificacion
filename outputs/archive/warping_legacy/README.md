# Legacy warped outputs (archived)

This folder stores datasets generated by the previous warping pipeline. They are kept for reference only and are not produced by the current lung-only flow.

- `full_warped_dataset/`: Full-coverage warping outputs (includes background outside the lungs).
- `warped_dataset/`: Earlier warped dataset outputs from the legacy settings.

Current lung-only outputs live under `outputs/warped_lung_best/`.
